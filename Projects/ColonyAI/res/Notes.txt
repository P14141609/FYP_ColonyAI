ToDo:
	Need to determine a 'home' location based on distance from Food and Water

	Resource Gathering:
		Resources need to be picked up
		Resources need to be placed at 'home'

	Obstacle Clearing:
		Objects between the 'home' and these resources will be purged

	Reproduction:
		Simple implementation needed

	Colony Role Delegation?

	Add specific Entity Memories?
	Add Saplings? for lumber replenishment

Bugs:
	perimeterNodes() accounts for inaccessible Nodes so nearby Trees etc are incorporated and cause issues
	Colonist's can have a path that is later revealed to pass through an object but nothing is done to stop the following of said path
	Fix delta heading somehow screwing up colonist.explore()
	window.close() causes memory exception
	delete_scalar.ccp exception occasionally
	Editor Hand position incorrect when view aspect ratio differs from window aspect ratio
